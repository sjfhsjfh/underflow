# Underflow

A little game.

## Guidelines

1. **DO NOT** commit directly on the `main` branch, unless it's something like a README update.
2. Create a new branch for each feature you are working on.
3. When you are done, create a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
4. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your commit messages.

## Before Release

- [ ] Check the `comui` version (use a specific commit hash).
- [ ] Make sure the `layout-debug` feature is disabled.
