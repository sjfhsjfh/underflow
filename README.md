# Underflow

A little game based on [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ezQUYwEq) and written in rust. 

## Build guide

Produce release build by using `cargo build -r`. This project requires Rust 2024 edition, so make sure that your 
Rust version is not older than `1.85.0`.

## Guidelines

1. **DO NOT** commit directly on the `main` branch, unless it's something like a README update.
2. Create a new branch for each feature you are working on.
3. When you are done, create a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
4. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your commit messages.
